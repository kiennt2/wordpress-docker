The first step is to prepare the plugin folder.

CRS 4.x will come with a plugins folder next to the rules folder. When using an older CRS release without a plugins folder, create one and place three empty config files in it (e.g. by using the shell command touch):

```bash
crs/plugins/empty-config.conf
crs/plugins/empty-before.conf
crs/plugins/empty-after.conf
```
